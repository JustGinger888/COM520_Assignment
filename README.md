# COM520 Assignment

## Introduction

### Task Centre Design vs user-centered Design

For this project, I decided to incorporate both TCD and UCD aspects within the overall design. The tasks must be simple and straightforward with no complexities, functioning in an ordered manner each accessible with no prior knowledge of the pages or site. The user-centered aspect comes in form of relevant illustrations and well laid out forms, each unique and non-dependant on the previous. My reasoning for this is because job seekers and employers alike do not want to struggle with the creation of accounts and doing their respective tasks. Even so, we live in a visually centered world where if there is an abundance of text or visually unappealing aspects to a site, it would immediately be judged and often categorized as unprofessional, leading to a lack of user engagement.

### Analysis of Sites

The Attached Excel Document analyses various other job sites and critically analyses them.

---

### User Group

The website is done for the Steady Paycheck Agency, which focuses on advertising and pushing jobs in the field of Information Technology to graduates with a relevant background. Hence there will be two user groups which I will be discussing below, Employers & Job Seekers.

#### Employers

Employers will be looking to post listings for positions on the site, advertising and gathering responses accordingly. They will need to be able to view all listings whether they be drafts, active, or expired with the appropriate options available to each. They should also be able to see the responses to the respective job listings in their own individual enclosure. Employers must have a job creation-centered view as they would not want to search for any open positions themselves.

##### Tasks & Goals

- Sign up
- To post a job, employers must be able to sign up and create a profile by inputting data.
- Post a job
- Once registered or signed in, they can post a job by filling out a form discussing details.
- View Potential Candidates
- Once posted, a list of candidates can be viewed under the relevant job position.

##### Experience Levels

- Posters would usually be higher up in the organization and have some experience with creating listings and recruiting suitable candidates.

##### Required Information

- Username
- Password
- Company Information
- Job Listings

#### Job Seeker

Job Seekers will be looking to find open vacancies at multiple companies based on search parameters in their local area. They would also want to upload and have easy access to their CV and personal information. Moreover, a way to create a CV easily and effectively which they can use to apply would be ideal for Seekers.

##### Tasks & Goals

- Sign up
- Seekers can sign up to the website in order to upload their CV and easily apply for jobs
- Create CV
- They can create a CV based on 3 major parameters and follow the process step by step in order to produce a template
- Search
- The search would allow Seekers, Signed in or not, to search for a specific job in their area and display the results to be further examined
- Apply
- Once a job has been found users can apply for it accordingly

##### Experience Levels

- Job Seekers would be inexperienced and often freshly graduated, not having much knowledge of applying for jobs.

##### Required Information

- Username
- Password
- Education & Qualifications
- Work Experience
- Skills & Technologies

## Design Proposition

I decided to use Adobe XD due to its extensive plugin lineup, providing illustrations and icons to make for a coherent and modern design throughout my prototype. The sharing and online design viewer is also relatively easy to use and share.

The project itself contains a login and sign-up view, CV uploading and creation sections, A search functionality for Job Seekers, and a dashboard for employers to post and view responses on job applications.

As I am relatively inexperienced with this tool, especially for a project of this scale there are some quirks that make it hard to navigate. Most noticeably on the qualification section of the CV creator where you have to click the arrow twice to progress through.

## Testing & Integration

Part three will be to test the final product, collect feedback and reflect on the interface towards more progressive design. As GUI testing techniques vary in terms of scale and scope, you need to select the best testing approach in order to determine how the application and the user interact and whether the application performs properly. Testing typically includes how the application handles keyboard and mouse input and how it displays screen text, images, buttons, menus, dialog boxes, icons and toolbars. Functional testing is commonly done by human testers, but is made a lot easier and more reliable by automated testing tools. Your prototype will probably only be intended to test a portion of the design. The report documentation should identify the following with regard to the prototypes:

In order to test your proof of concept (Prototype), you need to get 5 participants to fill in the following table individually.
