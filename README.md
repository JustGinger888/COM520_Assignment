## Design Proposition

I decided to use Adobe XD due to its extensive plugin lineup, providing illustrations and icons to make for a coherent and modern design throughout my prototype. The sharing and online design viewer is also relatively easy to use and share. 

The project itself contains a login and sign up view, CV uploading and creation sections, A search functionality for Job Seekers and a dashboard for employers to post and view responses on job applications.

As I am relatively inexperienced with this tool, especially for a project of this scale there are some quirks that make it hard to navigate. Most noticeably on the qualification section of the CV creator where you have to click the arrow twice to progress through.
